ham	right mike i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eye s which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time w images than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes changes things big time rgds rob original message from

NUMBER NUMBER pm NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER rob shavell wrote content who cares about content that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day i d have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i don t buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about NUMBER hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just don t understand kids today and they ll run with this i wasn t saying that mms wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy i was saying that i couldn t see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications i m looking for the compelling reason even if it s a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i don t think NUMBER hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots that s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part i m guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers i m not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them that s why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but it s just nice on occasion i still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method what s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it i m searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea i ve heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of what happened before the press even gets there willing to be proven wrong mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are then mms is never going to catch on URL

ham	hi kragen this is an interesting analysis i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick for example i don t expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while i think that the most important issue which is that end users won t be able to fix their systems is almost passed over i know that you know this and you allude to it but your essay is getting passed around so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others there s one other point which you don t make which i think is very important which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can t happen without libraries of available vulnerability code i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped uninvited about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples in the open that you can define a set and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure we wouldn t have stackguard itsNUMBER nissus or snort and the security admin s job would be a lot harder adam on thu aug NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERam NUMBER eugen leitl wrote eugen leitl a href URL leitl a ______________________________________________________________

forwarded message date thu NUMBER aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER edt from kragen sitaker kragen pobox com to fork URL subject the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards on august NUMBERth an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement which is appended to this email briefly idefense which bills itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell anyone else if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure at the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as full disclosure people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem they publish the information including code to exploit the vulnerability if possible this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by cert in the late NUMBERs which its proponents might call responsible disclosure never release working exploit code and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features and often even after the patches were released people wouldn t apply them because they didn t know how serious the problem was the underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the underground vulnerable the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact including disabling software turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and detecting and responding to intrusions they are therefore much less useful to would be intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems and so prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as long as possible idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms they want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash not long before snosoft a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulnerability in hp s truNUMBER unix secret if hp retained snosoft s consulting services hp considered this extortion and responded with legal threats and snosoft published the information if this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which together add up to a catastrophe first secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder and to nobody else for reasons explained later i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people the result will be just as in the responsible disclosure days that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret i ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software but i don t think that s plausible if someone can steal NUMBER NUMBER because a software bug lets them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the people who administer the software aren t liable either when credit card data are stolen from an e commerce site for example knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web site administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some negative pr but it can net the thief thousands of dollars i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught inevitably that means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist there might be the occasional case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remote root hole in samba for example right now people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime let s not let that happen this is the original idefense announcement from sunil james mailto sjames URL sent wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm subject introducing idefense s vulnerability contributor program greetings idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following provides answers to some basic questions about the program q how will it work a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number of motivations including the following pure love of security research the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks the desire to urge vendors to fix their products the publicity that often accompanies disclosure the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the work the compensation will depend among other things on the following items the kind of information being shared i e vulnerability or exploit the amount of detail and analysis provided the potential severity level for the information shared the types of applications operating systems and other software and hardware potentially affected verification by idefense labs the level of exclusivity if any for data granted to idefense q who should contribute to the vcp a the vcp is open to any individual security research group or other entity q why are you launching this program a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor under the idefense program the contributor is compensated idefense labs verifies the issue and idefense clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner q who gets the credit a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information q when can i contribute the vcp is active you are welcome to begin contributing today to learn more go to URL if you have questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the vcp please contact us at

ham	this is just an semi educated guess if i m wrong someone please correct me spamd setuid s to the user running spamc since you re calling spamc from a global procmailrc file it s being run as root most likely if called as root spamd won t open user_prefs files from the spamc man page u username this argument has been semi obsoleted to have spamd use per user config files run spamc as the user whose config files spamd should load if you re running spamc as some other user though eg root mail nobody cyrus etc then you can still use this flag the solution is to set dropprivs yes in etc procmailrc just before running spamc from the procmailrc man page dropprivs if set to yes procmail will drop all privileges it might have had suid or sgid this is only useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the etc procmailrc file is executed on behalf of the recipient i hope that helps and i also hope it s right st original message from spamassassin talk admin URL mailto spamassassin talk admin URL on behalf of cheryl l southard sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to spamassassin talk URL subject satalk user_prefs ignored hi all i am running spamassassin NUMBER NUMBER with procmail as my local delivery agent with sendmail i use spamc spamd so that it runs site wide from etc procmailrc spamd is run as root with the flags d a c and spamc isn t run with any flags when i was testing the program i deployed spamc from my personal procmailrc file my spamassassin user_prefs file was read each time i can see this because i have a non default required_hits value which gets reported in every e mail on the x spam status line now that i run spamc from the global etc procmailrc file my spamassassin user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from e mails from outside computers the required_hits value gets set back to the one in etc mail spamassassin local cf however if i send local e mail my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly does anyone know how to fix this problem if this is a spamassassin or procmail bug thanks cheryl cheryl southard cld URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL 
ham	jm URL justin mason writes except for NUMBER thing defanged mime messages that s a big problem but if you didn t just remove the headers and instead reverted back to the x spam prev versions it d more or less work btw fixed the downloads page check now un defangs mime it was screwing up some of my mass check results where sa markup was present yes if there ever was a warning about sa markup in mass check it never worked for me dan

ham	errr not to be pedantic or anything but this is called omit one testing or oot in the literature iirc helpful in case you re searching for additional information say at URL for instance david leblanc seattle wa usa 
ham	tim peters wrote i ve run no experiments on training set size yet and won t hazard a guess as to how much is enough i m nearly certain that the NUMBERh NUMBERs i ve been using is way more than enough though okay i believe you each call to learn and to unlearn computes a new probability for every word in the database there s an official way to avoid that in the first two loops e g for msg in spam gb learn msg true false gb update_probabilities i did that it s still really slow when you have thousands of messages in each of the last two loops the total of ham and total of spam in the learned set is invariant across loop trips and you could break into the abstraction to exploit that the only probabilities that actually change across those loop trips are those associated with the words in msg then the runtime for each trip would be proportional to the of words in the msg rather than the number of words in the database i hadn t tried that i figured it was better to find out if all but one testing had any appreciable value it looks like it doesn t so i ll forget about it another area for potentially fruitful study it s clear that the highest value indicators usually appear early in msgs and for spam there s an actual reason for that advertising has to strive to get your attention early so for example if we only bothered to tokenize the first NUMBER of a msg would results get worse spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning of the message in pratice that would probably work fine sometimes an on topic message starts well but then rambles never i remember the time when i was ten years old and went down to the fishing hole with my buddies this guy named gordon had a really huge head wait maybe that was joe well no matter as i recall it was a hot day and everyone was tired human growth hormone girl with huge breasts blah blah blah
